### Process of creation
- This project was bootstrapped with Create React App
- I used create-react-app to generate the app, then I ejected it in order to add a few additional features to the build process.
- I've added sass-loader to webpack to use SASS instead of regular CSS.
- The app follows a modular architecture to organize the different components.
- I use the ES6 (...and more) syntax as much as possible.
- I don't use Redux because it's not needed for such a small app.
